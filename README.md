# First thing...

I thank God for graciously, through His mercy, giving me all the necessary knowledge acquired throughout my life and throughout the development of this project. It is only through His grace and provision that this was possible, and I am truly grateful for His presence every step of the way.

**For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen.**
`Apostle Paul in Romans 11:36`

## Your Comprehensive Video Streaming Solution

At AVideo, we provide more than just a platform; we offer a comprehensive solution for hosting, managing, monetizing, and expanding your video content. Embrace the future of video streaming and unlock the full potential of your content with AVideo. 

# How AVideo is organized

AVideo is divided into three distinct components: the streamer, the encoder, and the live server. The streamer is utilized to play and manage videos, while the encoder converts your videos into a web-compatible format. The live server, on the other hand, is used to broadcast live videos.

## Why do I need the Encoder?

There may be several reasons why you may consider installing the encoder, such as having a faster server compared to the public encoder server, or if you prefer a private method for encoding your videos

Additionally, if your server is on a private network and does not have a public IP address, or if it uses an IP address within the 10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8 (Localhost), 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16 range, it is mandatory to install an encoder in order for it to properly communicate with the streamer site.

## Agreement on the Purpose of Software Installation

This Software must be used for Good, never Evil. The use of this software for creating content related to sexually explicit material, pornography, or adult themes is strictly forbidden. Such usage goes against the values and principles of our platform and is not permitted under any circumstances.

# Crucial Advisory: Strictly Avoid Using Control Panels for Installation

**Important**: For the installation of the Streamer, Encoder, and Livestream components, it is imperative to use a Linux distribution, specifically Ubuntu, **without any type of control panel**. This includes avoiding panels like cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, and similar.

Control panels significantly interfere with the necessary system access and processes required for a successful installation. They restrict the installation of essential libraries and the compilation of critical software, such as Nginx for the Livestream component.

**Please be advised**: Installing our system on a server with any control panel is highly discouraged and is likely to result in installation failure. We cannot provide support or guarantee success in such scenarios. For a smooth and functional installation, it is essential to follow this guideline strictly.
